🧾 Project Report — Live Weather Forecast Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Live Weather Forecast Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to visualize and compare weather conditions across multiple Indian cities — Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Shillong, and Noida.
It integrates real-time weather and air quality data using API-based KPIs, providing a dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing report for data-driven insights.

🎯 Objective

To analyze and monitor real-time weather metrics such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, Visibility, Air Quality, and Forecast Trends for multiple cities in India — enabling quick understanding of environmental and climatic conditions.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation

Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For KPI calculations (AQI, Color Codes, Suggestions, etc.)

API Integration – Real-time weather data fetch (OpenWeather API / similar source)

Data Modelling – Relationship setup for dynamic city selection and measure calculations

📊 Key Features

✅ Real-time weather KPIs (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, UV Index)
✅ Dynamic forecast visualization for 7-day trends
✅ Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis with status & color-coded ranges
✅ AQI suggestions using DAX (e.g., “Air is clean”, “Avoid outdoor activity”, etc.)
✅ Sunrise & Sunset time visualization
✅ Chance of Rain analysis using bar indicators
✅ City-wise navigation (Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Shillong, Noida)

📈 Insights

The dashboard dynamically displays weather patterns and AQI variations across cities.

Helps identify air pollution levels and weather severity in real time.

Provides actionable insights for citizens and policy decision-making based on air quality.

🚀 Impact

This dashboard demonstrates strong data modeling, real-time integration, and DAX-based analytical thinking, showcasing practical Data Analytics & BI skills applicable in environmental monitoring and smart city projects.
